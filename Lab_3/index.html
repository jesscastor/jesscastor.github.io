      <h2>Welcome Spooder lovers and Arachnophobics</h2>
      <p>This is a fake website in honor of my love for jumping spooders</p>
      <p>This is the place where we convert arachnophobes to spooder lovers (At least jumping spooders). Jumping spiders are widely known
        as the cats of the arachnid world due to their movements and curious nature. They are so cute that a disney/pixar animator made a short film 
        featuring the character, Lucas the jumping spider (shown up above),  that became widly popular. With there being over 6000 species, 
        they are the largest family of spiders in the world making up 13% of all spider species.
        Jumping spiders most known characteristic is their large eyes. They have four eyes in total, 2 in front and 2 in back. 
        Their vision is better than most anthropods out there.</p>
