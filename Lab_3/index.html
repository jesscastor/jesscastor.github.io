        <h2>Welcome Spooder lovers and Arachnophobics</h2>
        <p>This is a fake website in honor of my love for jumping spooders</p>
        <p>
          This is the place where we convert arachnophobes to spooder lovers (At
          least jumping spooders). Jumping spiders are widely known as the cats
          of the arachnid world due to their movements and curious nature. They
          are so cute that a disney/pixar animator made a short film featuring
          the character, Lucas the jumping spider (shown up above), that became
          widly popular. With there being over 6000 species, they are the
          largest family of spiders in the world making up 13% of all spider
          species. Jumping spiders most known characteristic is their large
          eyes. They have four eyes in total, 2 in front and 2 in back. Their
          vision is better than most anthropods out there.
